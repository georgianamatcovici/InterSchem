I created the project Interschem alongside my colleague, Sebastian Maftei, for the Introduction to Programming discipline.
Interschem is a logical scheme interpreter written using C++ language and designed for creating schemes that represent algorithms. The program has a user-friendly interface created by using graphics.h library. There are 6 types of blocks available on the right side of the interface which can be used to create a logical scheme by moving them to the main menu. By making connections between blocks, we can create logical schemes that represent algorithms. The application allows running these programs and generating the corresponding C++ code.
